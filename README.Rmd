# About

Welcome to the `R` package `novelforestSG`! It contains the raw forest community data used in Lai et al. (2021), and also comprised part of the raw data used in Neo et al. (2017).

In addition, it provides a `download_model()` function to download the `brms` model fitted in Lai et al. (2021). Note that the model object also contains input data that include the environmental variables of forest plots (see below).

# Installation

From CRAN:
```
install.packages("novelforestSG")
```
Or install the development version (especially if the devel version > CRAN version as stated above):
```
install.packages("remotes")  # prerequisite
remotes::install_github("hrlai/novelforestSG")
```

# Using the data

To access the raw data:
```
library(novelforestSG)
novelforest_data
```
For more information, see `?novelforest_data`.

To access the summarised data and environmental variables, first download the model object. The model object is too large (16.5 MB) to come with the package, but the `download_model` function will download the model from our [GitHub development website](https://github.com/hrlai/novelforestSG):
```
mod <- download_model()
```
Then, extract the input data from the model object:
```
in_dat <- mod$data
```
In the input/summarised data, you will find the environmental variables as certain columns. These plot-level measurements can be matched to the stem-level raw data via plot names. See `?download_model` for more details.

Because the predictor variables were log-transformed and then scale to zero mean and unit SD prior to modelling, you may wish to backtransform them to their original scales, simply by:
```
backtransform(in_dat)
```

# Dependencies

Because we analysed the data using the `brms` v2.10.0 package in `R`, it is highly recommended that you [install `brms`](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) to squeeze the most out of the model output:
```
install.packages("brms")
```
You may also need `RTools` or `Xcode`, depending on your operating system; see [the `brms` homepage](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms#user-content-how-do-i-install-brms). This will take a few minutes so have a cup of hot beverage handy.

# Issues

Please feel free to report any issues to [our GitHub Issue page](https://github.com/hrlai/novelforestSG/issues).

# Citation

We believe that the sharing of datasets is important for advancing ecology. At the same time, for data sharing to be successful and sustainable, it is important that those individuals whose time and efforts generated the data are acknowledged. Therefore, when you use the data or model output in your original research or meta-analysis, we appreciate if the following paper is cited:
